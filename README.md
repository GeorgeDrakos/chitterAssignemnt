# Chitter
 Chitter Mobile App for the API given to me by the Manchester Metropolitan University
 
 ## Cloning Instructions
 
 Please ignore the chittr_server_v5 and chittr_server_v6 as you should have your own server to run the project on.
 
 ### Installation
 
 You will need node.js which can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) as well as android studio which can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/)
 
 After sucessfully cloning the MobAppDev folder make sure to run the following command on the root directory of the project.
 
 ```bash
 npm install
 ```
 
 After this you should have a an AVD from Android studio open then on the same directory you ran the above command you can start the application by typing
 
 ```bash
 npx react-native run-android
 ```
 Once you see the "Home" screen appear to the mobile emulator you are ready to use the app as intended
